# Food Markets and Socioeconomic Inequality Analysis in Chicago
The map reveals a correlation between the distribution of supermarkets and poverty rates in Chicago:

- __Near North Side communtiy has the highest number of new supermarkets__ (5), while "Lower West Side" and "Logan Square" have 3 new supermarkets each, with an additional one on the boundary for each. These communities already have a high density of supermarkets; Communities with lower poverty rates, mostly located around the Loop and the north side, generally have more supermarkets. In contrast, __communities with higher poverty rates, mainly located in the west and south sides with a high percentage of Hispanic and Black residents, have fewer supermarkets, especially in Englewood and East Garfield Park__. An analysis of teen pregnancy rates I did for assignment 1 also showed that these communities have some of the highest rates. The __distribution of supermarkets and poverty rates aligns with the spatial patterns of teen pregnancy rates__.

`Correlation between the distribution of supermarkets and obesity rates`

- To further explore the correlation between supermarket distribution and the health well-being of residents, I used the "PLACES: Local Data for Better Health" data developed by the CDCLinks to an external site., which includes 20 different health indicators at the census tract level. I chose the Obesity crude rate indicator as a measure of health well-being because of the link between access to healthy food and obesity rates. The map confirmed my hypothesis that the spatial pattern of obesity crude rates overlaps with poverty rates, and communities with few supermarkets have much higher poverty and obesity rates than those in the north side or the Loop with more available supermarkets; Transportation is also more convenient in the Loop and the north side. However, for people living in the west and south sides, travel costs are higher, and supermarket availability is more limited, leading to lower accessibility. Therefore, even with the same distance to supermarkets, accessibility is lower for them compared to wealthy residents in the Northside and the Loop, which highlights the importance of availability, accessibility, and travel costs aspects that we discussed in class.

`Final hypothesis`
- Distribution of supermarkets in Chicago is correlated with the socioeconomic level of the local community, and the spatial pattern of supermarket distribution also affects the health well-being of local residents. I would also assume that the quality of supermarkets is correlated with the quantity of supermarkets and SES to some extent. I attempted to map public transportation availability data, but I could not find any. However, I hypothesize that communities with limited supermarket access also have limited access to public transportation. This emphasizes the importance of investing in basic infrastructure and facilities in underinvested communities to ensure the well-being of residents. Although supermarkets are distributed unevenly, there are several new supermarkets in the west and south sides, indicating a positive change.

*Note*: To navigate the map, feel free to toggle on and off the layers. The app I shared has the poverty rate layer on and the obesity layer off, but you can switch that easily by clicking the third icon on the sidebar and choosing the layers you want to view.
